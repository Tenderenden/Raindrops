# Raindrops
This code is made to test and visualize raindrop algorithm intended to use with LED matrix.

### Pattern
To create this code I used following code/videos as a pattern:
* [Purple rain in Web Editor](https://editor.p5js.org/codingtrain/sketches/5C07OcK6A)
* [Coding Challenge #4 - official site](https://thecodingtrain.com/challenges/4-purple-rain)
* [Coding Challenge #4 - Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkyIDI6rQJI)
* [Github repo with Python code](https://github.com/MorelT98/coding-challenges/blob/master/004_purple_rain.py)
